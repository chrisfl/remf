REMF is an encryption utility: Robust Encryption for Messaging and Files

It is an amateur's attempt at building a working encryption algorithm and applying it to, as the name suggests, messaging (i.e. email, but also including delivered content i.e. web content) and files. In the latter case, it is meant to act as an OS-independent encryption directory, with its own effective filesystem. The goal is to specify a region of a given drive as REMF data, which will appear to the host OS to be a single file, but which REMF can parse to identify individual files.

Granted, an amateur ought generally not attempt cryptography, but a) I have enough of a mathematical background to, in my eyes, warrant such an attempt, and b) I am not exactly using this for state secrets. This is an excuse to attempt various programming techniques and to amuse myself, and even if na√Øve, I should like to think my algorithm is in fact a good one.

More to come.
